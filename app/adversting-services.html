                            The power of social media is undeniable. We have fantastic social media channels coming up every now and then, and each new one is better than the previous one.

                            Social media platforms are now one of the best places for people to hang out. They scroll through Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest more than they hang out with their actual friends. Thus, this is where your business needs to be. However, one thing you need to consider is that every platform is an individual's personal space. And you probably won't be invited to their area at all. Thus, you need to be clear-headed about the space you want to target and then create strategies that will lead you towards it.

                    What makes a great website?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="services-single-desc">
                        How are the search engines going to rate you? On what basis will Google judge you for being an epic website? A lot of companies will assure you that they have the exact answer to this. The reality is; they don't. Basically, nobody has a straightforward solution to this question. At Optisource, we have been working for the past 20 years to provide the best and positive outcomes to our clients in SEO. After years of experience, we have learned that there is no specific feature through which Google judges your website and declares it to be great. There are tons of different things through which your website is judged. For the time being, to keep the matter precise, here are the most essential and necessary things that compile a great website:
                        <br><br>
                            <ul class="d-flex flex-column services-single-desc">
                                <li>Provide accurate information to clients that they are looking for.</li>
                                <li>Make sure that the visitors are engaging with you.</li>
                                <li>Boost your brand in all possible ways and build trust</li>
                                <li>Verify who you are and where you are</li>
                                <li>A well-optimised website that opens quickly on PCs, tablets, and mobiles.</li>
                                <li>Respond to all screen sizes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        All of these factors are equally important, and all of them can be the reason your website gets ranked higher by Google. Your website is measured on all of these factors and even the minor ones. If you wish to dig down deeper into this matter, then you can avail our digital marketing audit and find out about all the features that play a massive role in making your website GREAT. Now, this is where digital marketing kicks in.

                    Responsive Website Design:
                    </h3>
                    <p class="services-single-desc">
                        Mobiles and tablets are being used endlessly now. No matter where you are, you can search for a specific product or brand within a matter of seconds. Thus, with such an immense rise in mobile usage, it is incredibly crucial that your website is well-optimized for all platforms.
                        <br><br>
                        You are clueless about the size of the screen that will be used by the user to view your website. Likewise, you won't know the medium through which they will search for you. It can be a mobile or a tablet, and it can be a PC or laptop. Therefore, your website should fit all screen sizes, and the resolution must be high as well. No matter what screen size your site is being viewed on, it should not lose its charm.
                        <br><br>
                        Responsive website design has a lot of impact on SEO. It is not only offering the user a smart and user-friendly website, but it is also leaving a perfect impression on Google. It is beyond just aesthetics. A site that looks nice but does not open quickly and easily on all devices is not going to win the hearts. Thus, to provide a positive and happy customer experience to your visitors, you need to optimize your website finely.
                        <br><br>
                        At Optisource, we pay immense attention to the significant and minor details of responsive website design. We make sure that your website not only looks great but is also user-friendly on all devices. We put in all efforts to create an aesthetically pleasing site that functions efficiently too.
